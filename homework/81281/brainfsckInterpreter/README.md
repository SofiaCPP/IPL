# Homework 3.2

## Create a brainf*** interpreter

_The interpreter reads from a file if there is input._

### How to install and use SWI-Prolog

+ [How to install SWI-Prolog](https://wwu-pi.github.io/tutorials/lectures/lsp/010_install_swi_prolog.html)

+ [Quick start on how to use it](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=quickstart)

+ [Command line options](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=cmdline)

### Added bash script for executing program after successful installation of SWI-Prolog on a Unix or Unix-like variants

[Script](./runMeChooseMode.sh)

_Mode 0 is for interactive interpretation and 1 is for interpretation of a file._

**The interpreter is a bit slow if the program has a lot of loops with the current method of handling loops. Also Prolog isn't the fastest PL of them all xD.**
