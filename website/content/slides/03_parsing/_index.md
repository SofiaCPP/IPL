### Parser

> Recognizes the rules of the language and builds the Abstract Syntax Tree
> (AST) of the program from the stream of tokens.

---
### Grammars

The grammar of a languages defines the structure of correct sentences and how to
derive their meaning.

---
#### CFG

Context Free Grammars are:

1. formal grammars - they describe all the strings in a formal language
2. context free - there is only one non-terminal on left hand side of each rule

        <expr> ::= <expr> <op> <expr> | (<expr>) | <term>
        <op>   ::= + | - | * | /
        <term> ::= [0-9]+

> Does this grammar allow for operator precedence? (No, more later)

---
##### Terminals and Non-terminals

The grammar has two alphabets:

1. Terminals - symbols in the strings of the language, only on right side of
   rules
2. Non-terminals - stand on left side in each rule and can be used on the right
   side

---
##### Terminals and Non-terminals

In the expression grammar:

- terminals - ( ) + - * / 0-9
- non-terminals - expr, op, term

---
#### Backus-Naur Form - BNF

Notation for describing context-free grammars.


    <expr> ::= <expr> <op> <expr> | "(" <expr> ")" | <term>
    <op>   ::= "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"
    <term> ::= <digit> | <digit><term>
    <digit>::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"

---
#### Extended Backus-Naur Form - EBNF

Extended BNF for more compact represenation of grammars. There are different
specifications for EBNF, but they have the same power, just different syntax.

- https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-notation


        expr  = expr , op , expr | "(" , expr ,  ")" | term
        op    = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"
        term  = { digit }
        digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"


---
#### PEG

Parser Expression Grammars are similar to CFG, but are more convenient for
parsing, since the choice operator is not ambiguous.

- the choice operator is `/` (not `|`) and it is not commutative
- CFG allows selecting any matching variant and can have more than one parse
  tree.
    - parsing algorithms try to resolve this by extra rules
- PEG prioritizes the variants in the order that they are written.


---
#### PEG

    <expr>  ::= <sum>
    <sum>   ::= <prod> ([+-] <prod>)*
    <prod>  ::= <value> ([*/] <value>)*
    <value> ::= [0-9]+ / '(' <expr> ')'

- That is a CFG as well, so for some grammars there is no difference.
- Some languages can be expressed only with ambiguous grammars.

---
#### CFG vs PEG

Where the `else` goes?

    <if> ::= if <expr> <stmnt> else <stmnt>
        / if <expr> <stmnt>


    if x0 if x1 s1 else s2

    if x0 { if x1 s1 } else s2 // 1
    if x0 { if x1 s1 else s2 } // 2

- CFG - it is ambiguous
- PEG - 2 - because it is the first option

---
#### Program

    function answer() {
        return 6*7;
    }

---
###### Tokens

- keyword: `function`
- identifier: `answer`
- symbol: `(`
- symbol: `)`
- symbol: `{`
- keyword: `return`
- number: 6
- symbol: `*`
- number: 7
- symbol: `;`
- symbol: `}`

---
## Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

- https://esprima.org/demo/parse.html?code=function%20answer()%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20return%206%20*%207%3B%0A%7D
- https://astexplorer.net/

---
### Concrete Syntax tree (CST)

- aka Parse Tree
- aka Derivation Tree

> The tree that starts from the grammar inital non-terminal and generates
> a string in the language.

---
### Abstract vs Concrete

> AST differ from CST because superficial distinctions of form, unimportant for
> translation, do not appear in AST.

---

We will be focusing solely on AST, since it is used for translation and it
  easy to skip the CST and generate directly AST.

---
## Creating an AST

- Most implementations use a common base class for each Node type and a derived
  class for each specific node

    struct Node {
        virtual ~Node() = 0;
    };

    typedef std::unique_ptr<Node> NodePtr;

---
### Node for a `for` cycle

    struct ForNode : Node {
        virtual ~ForNode() override = default;
        NodePtr m_Init;
        NodePtr m_Condition;
        NodePtr m_Increment;
        NodePtr m_Body;
    };

---
### Using the AST

- Compilers use the AST a lot to:
    - remove syntactic sugar
    - optmize
    - generate IR or code
- It makes sense to be able to execute different code on the AST

---
#### How to work with the AST?

- a `virtual` method for each operation?
- a recursive function (or a stack) with `switch` for each node type?

> No, adding a new algorithm or a node will be difficult in both cases.

---
## Visitor pattern

> Represent an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure.

> Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the
> elements on which it operates.

---
### Visitor in C++

    struct NodeVisitor {
        virtual ~NodeVisitor() = 0;
        virtual Visit(IfNode& node) = 0;
        virtual Visit(ForNode& node) = 0;
        // etc
    };

- There must be overloads for all the Node types.
- It is expected that the nodes change very rarely, while new visitors are
  constantly added.

---
### Node

    struct NodeVisitor;

    struct Node {
        virtual ~Node() = 0;
        virtual void Visit(NodeVisitor& visitor) = 0;
    };

---
#### Node for a `for` cycle

    struct ForNode : Node {
        virtual ~ForNode() override = default;
        virtual void Visit(NodeVisitor& visitor) override {
            visitor.Visit(*this);
        }

        NodePtr m_Init;
        NodePtr m_Condition;
        NodePtr m_Increment;
        NodePtr m_Body;
    };

---
### Parsing algorithms

- There a lot of algorithms for parsing grammars, with different time / memory
  tradeoffs
- The algorithms can be:
    - top-down or bottom-up
    - left-most derivation or right-most derivation

- Most of the algorithms require making the grammar follow a specific form and
  then explain how to create a parser for the language.

---
### Parsing algorithms

- Recursive descent parsing
- Operator-precedence parsing
- Pratt parsing - top-down operator-precedence parsing
- Packrat parsing
- [LL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser)
- [LR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser)
- [LALR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser)

These are the major grammar forms and parsing algorithms. While they are not
exactly the same in terms of algorithms and power.

{{<  note >}}

- First three are easy to implement by hand, the second three are better
  generated.
- Pratt parsing is a mix between recursive descent and operator-precedence.

## Hand-crafted parser

Disclaimer: It is possible to write every parser manually, but we'll be
discussing:

- top-down AKA recursive-descent parsers
- operator precedence parser

When we get to generated parsers, will be discussing bottom-up parsers as well.

---
## Hand-crafted parser

How to write a hand-crafted parser?

1. Start with a grammar
2. For each *Non-terminal* *E* write a function that parses it and generates AST
   for it.

---
### How to parse a *Non-terminal*

for each rule that has *E* as a symbol on the left, make a case in the function
that parser the rule.

- '|'  is translated to `if` and `match(XXX)` or check whether a subexpression
  has been parsed.
- `*` (repeats) are translated to `while (match(XXX))`
- *Non-terminals* are translated to calls to their functions
- *terminals* are translated to `require(XXX)`

Where `XXX` is a token (aka *terminal*).

### Math expression example

---
#### Grammar

    <expr>  ::= <sum>
    <sum>   ::= <prod> ([+-] <prod>)*
    <prod>  ::= <value> ([*/] <value>)*
    <value> ::= [0-9]+ / '(' <expr> ')'

---
##### Handling precedence

- The higher the precedence -> the lower in the tree
- Lower precedence *non-terminals* generate higher ones

        <sum>   ::= <prod> ([+-] <prod>)*
        <prod>  ::= <value> ([*/] <value>)*

---
##### Handling associativity

- Left associative operators go deep (loop) on the left
- Right associative operators go deep (loop) on the right
- Or can be handled in the parser

        <sum>   ::= <prod> [+-] <prod> | <sum> [+-] <prod>

---
#### Recursive descent

---
##### Expr

    // <expr>  ::= <sum>

    AST parse_expr() {
        return parse_sum();
    }

---
##### Sum

    // <sum>   ::= <prod> ([+-] <prod>)*

    AST parse_sum() {
        AST left = parse_prod();
        auto token = next_token();
        while (token == '+' || token == '-') {
            AST right = parse_prod();
            left = make_op(token, left, right);
        }
        return left;
    }

---
##### Prod

    // <prod>  ::= <value> ([*/] <value>)*

    AST parse_prod() {
        AST left = parse_value();
        auto token = next_token();
        while (token == '*' || token == '/') {
            AST right = parse_value();
            left = make_op(token, left, right);
        }
        return left;
    }

---
##### Value

    // <value> ::= [0-9]+ / '(' <expr> ')'

    AST parse_value() {
        auto token = next_token();
        if (token == NUMBER) {
            return make_number(token);
        }
        else if (token == '(') {
            AST expr = parse_expr();
            require_token(')');
            return expr;
        }
        throw error;
    }

---
#### Operator precedence

[Shunting yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm)

---
    int precedence(token) {
        switch (token) {
            case EOF: return 0;
            case '(': return 2;
            case ')': return 5;
            case '+':
            case '-': return 10;
            case '*':
            case '/': return 20;
        }
    }
---

    AST parse_expr() {
        stack<AST> output;
        stack<Token> operators;

        do {
            auto token = next_token();
            handle_token(token, output, operators);
        } while (token != EOF);

        AST result = output.top();
        output.pop();
        assert(output.empty());
        return result;
    }

---

    void handle_token(token, output, operators) {
        if (token == NUMBER) {
            output.push(make_number(token));
        } else {
            handle_operator(token, output, operators);
        }
    }

---

    void handle_operator(token, output, operators) {
        auto prec = precedence(token);
        while (!operators.empty() &&
            (precedence(operators.top()) >= prec)) {
            output_tree(operators.top());
            operators.pop();
        }
        if (token == ')') {
            assert(operators.top() == '(');
            operators.pop();
        } else if (token != EOF) { // '(' or an operator
            operators.push(token);
        }
    }

---

    void output_tree(Token operator, output) {
        auto rhs = output.top();
        output.pop();
        auto lhs = output.top();
        output.pop();
        output.push(make_op(operator, lhs, rhs));
    }

---

Most hand-written parsers use combination of recursive descent and operator
precendence for expression for better performance when parsing expressions.

# Homework

Extend the xxx2html tool to:

1. Produce pretty-printed html
    - bonus: support line length limit
2. Produce html where functions have their background colored depending on
   cyclomatic complexity ranging from light green to light read.
3. Produce html where control structures can be collapsed.

Do only one of these.
