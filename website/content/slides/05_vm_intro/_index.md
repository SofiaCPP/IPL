# Virtual Machines - Wikipedia

> In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system.
> Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality
> of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized
> hardware, software, or a combination.

# Virtual Machines - Wikipedia

- system virtual machines - provide substitute for a real machine
- process virtual machines - allow executing of computer programs in a platform
  independent environment

> We will be looking only at the second type of virtual machines and VM will
> mean that for us.

# Virtual Machines

- Implement a computational model
- Just like real machines AKA computers
- run on top of the real machine

---

## Computational model

- Regular Languages 
- Context Free Languages
- *Everything that is computable*

---
## Computational model

- Regular Expressions
- Pushdown automata
- Turing machines

---
### Turing machine

- has infinite tape with cells
- each cells can hold one of finite number of values
- head that can read, write and move to the left and right
- finite set of states, one designated as starting state
- finite program that given (state, value) return the new (state, action, value)

# Homework

- implement a brainfuck interpreter
- implement

# ?
